Feature: Allow users to purchase products with their WoCoins.
  
  The user should be able to purchase products in the database with their WoCoins.
  The program should take a single command-line argument for the database file.
  It should present the root menu as in the previous feature:
  
  1: exit
  2: administrator
  3: user
  
  Option 2 should work exactly as in the previous feature. Option 3 should
  present a valid user with a menu of numbered options as follows:
  
  1: back
  2: create wallet
  3: add product
  4: remove product
  5: display products
  6: send message
  7: check messages
  8: check balance
  9: purchase product

  Choosing options 1--8 work as described in the previous feature. If option 9
  is chosen, the program should check to see if the user has an active
  wallet. If not, the program should respond with "User has no wallet."
  Otherwise, the program should prompt the user for the root wallet directory,
  with the default being the system's user home directory. If a valid wallet
  file (in subdirectory of the username) in that root does not exist, the
  program should output "Wallet does not exist." and return to the user menu.
  Finally, if the wallet file does exist in that subdirectory, but the public
  key (address) does not match that stored in the database, the program should
  output "Invalid wallet."
  
  If the user has a valid wallet file, the program should determine the user's
  current WoCoin balance and then display a list of all currently available
  products that were not added by the user (as the seller) and whose price is
  less than or equal to the user's balance. The numbered list of those items
  should be a part of a prompt for the item to be purchased. The numbered list
  of items should always start with item number 1 called "cancel", which simply
  outputs "Action canceled." and returns to the user menu if chosen.
  
  The remaining items should be numbered from 2 on, sorted in ascending order by
  price and, within the same price, alphabetically by title (case insensitive).
  If the user chooses an actual item (2 or above) in this list, the program
  should then submit a transaction from the user (using their wallet file) to
  the item's seller for the price of the item and remove the item from the
  purchasable products. The program should output "Item purchased."
